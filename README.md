#SEE: Simple ECMAScript Engine#

This is a mirror of SEE, a simple implementation of ECMA script version 1.5 originally from http://adaptive-enterprises.com/~d/software/see/ which has since been gone and which is not on Github. SEE includes an interactive ECMAscript shell.

##Instalation##
`./configure && make && make install`
